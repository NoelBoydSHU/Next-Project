I have used a MySQL backend, all details are stored within lib/db.js and .env.local

OTHER NOTES

I used cantor college's postcode etc for the google maps latitude and longitude because I couldnt find the one that was provided on google maps.

for the google maps API i will be cancelling the use after a month or else it'll cost me Â£300 lol.
